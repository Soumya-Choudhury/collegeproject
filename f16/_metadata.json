  "description": "Cockpit Noise 3 (F-16)\n acquired by recording samples from 1/2\" B&K condensor microphone onto digital audio tape (DAT). The noise was recorded at the co-pilot's seat in a two-seat F-16, traveling at a speed of 500 knots, and an altitude of 300-600 feet. The sound level during the recording process was 103 dBA. It was found that the flight condition had only a minor effect on the noise and, therefore, the reproduced noise can be considered to be representative."
