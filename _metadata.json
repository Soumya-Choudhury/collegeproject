The source of this babble is 100 people \nspeaking in a canteen. The room radius is over two meters; therefore, \nindividual voices are slightly audible. The sound level during the \nrecording process was 88 dBA.</li>\n                    <li><a href=\"http://spib.linse.ufsc.br/data/noise/factory1.mat\">Factory Floor Noise 1</a>\n acquired by recording samples from 1/2\" B&amp;K condensor microphone \nonto digital audio tape (DAT).
